# electricalsync

## Objective:

This project serves to analyse the synchronization between electrically coupled neurons in an spike-by-spike comparison and timing delays.


## Structure:

It comprises a Main script which handles:
  1. signal processing
  2. spike detection
  3. spike relocation (one neuron should be aware of missing spikes in the other one)
  4. Several analyses

It also includes an adittional Utilities script with custom functions (filters, ...)

## Installation:
Download folder electricalsync
Set propper environment
Import custom scripts ---> in the electricalsync main directory:   pip install -e .
